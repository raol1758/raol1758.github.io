<h1>Family</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    I live with my Mom and Dad in a suburb near Chicago.<br> My older brother Jeet, however, studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago and comes home on weekends.
    <br>Even though he is 6 years older than me, we get along pretty well.<br>The majority of our time together is spent playing video games or watching television.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is a game we used to play often:

    <br>
    The rest of my family (aunts, cousins, etc.) lives in India. Of course, this means I don't see them very often.<br>But when I do, we have a blast.

<h1>Family</h1>

<p>
    I live with my Mom and Dad in a suburb near Chicago. My older brother Jeet, however, studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago and comes home on weekends.
    Even though he is 6 years older than me, we get along pretty well. The majority of our time together is spent playing video games or watching television.
    The rest of my family (aunts, cousins, etc.) lives in India. Of course, this means I don't see them very often. But when I do, we have a blast.

<h2>India</h2>
<br>
<p>I've been to India three times throughout my life. The first time I was just a couple months old, the second time I was ten years old, and the third time I was twelve years old.
    From cows walking around the streets to the crazy monsoon, the whole experience is very interesting, to say the least.</p>

<h2>New York</h2>

<p>In the summer of 2016, I went to New York, Long Island with my family. We stayed with some friends and then visited the city.
    We saw the 9/11 Memorial, the World Trade Center, and the Statue of Liberty.
